# Lightener Curve Editor — CLAUDE.md

## What this is

A Home Assistant custom integration (HACS) that controls groups of lights with
per-light brightness curves. Fork of fredck/lightener with an interactive
curve-editor card.

## Quality gates

### Release ZIP structure (critical)

HACS `zip_release: true` extracts the zip **directly** into
`/config/custom_components/lightener/`. If the zip contains a
`custom_components/lightener/` prefix, files land at
`…/lightener/custom_components/lightener/` and HA silently fails with
"Integration not found" — no import error, no traceback, just gone.

**Rule:** The release zip MUST have `manifest.json` at the root. No
`custom_components/` prefix anywhere in the archive.

**Enforcement:** The `release.yml` workflow validates this automatically and
fails the release if the structure is wrong.

**Manual uploads:** Never manually upload a zip to a GitHub release. Always let
the release workflow build it via the `cd … && zip -r ./` pattern. If you must
rebuild manually, run from inside `custom_components/lightener/`:

```bash
cd custom_components/lightener
zip lightener.zip -r ./
# Verify:
unzip -l lightener.zip | grep -c "custom_components/"  # must be 0
```

### CARD_VERSION sync

`const CARD_VERSION` in `custom_components/lightener/frontend/lightener-panel.js` and
`js/src/lightener-curve-card.ts` must always match `manifest.json` `"version"`.
This is how the panel forces a fresh card module fetch after a HACS upgrade and
how the card exposes its version at runtime via `window.__LIGHTENER_CURVE_CARD_VERSION__`.

**Never edit `CARD_VERSION` by hand.** Run `scripts/sync-version` instead.

**Enforcement:** Three-layer automation keeps these in sync:
1. `scripts/ha-sync` calls `scripts/sync-version` automatically before every deploy
2. `release.yml` calls `scripts/sync-version` after patching `manifest.json` with the tag
3. `lint.yml` (`version-sync` job) runs `scripts/sync-version` and fails the PR if there is a diff

If CI reports "CARD_VERSION out of sync", run `scripts/sync-version` locally, commit the change.

### Coverage gates

CI enforces minimum coverage on both sides. Gates are floors (not strict
ratchets) set 3-6pp below measured baseline — they catch meaningful
regressions without flagging small refactors.

- **Python:** `pyproject.toml` `[tool.coverage.report] fail_under = 90`
  (baseline ~94.74% after PR-B). Enforced in `.github/workflows/lint.yml`
  pytest job via `--cov-fail-under=90`.
- **Frontend:** `js/vitest.config.ts` thresholds `lines: 75`, `branches: 65`,
  `functions: 75`, `statements: 75` (baseline 82.52/73.76/83.47/80.52).
  `src/lightener-curve-card.ts` is excluded until the god-file is under
  400 lines and can be covered directly.
- **Raising a gate:** run the suite locally (`npm run test:coverage` or
  `scripts/test-python --cov=custom_components/lightener`), confirm the new
  floor has at least ~3pp cushion above the measured number, then bump the
  config. Don't chase the measured baseline exactly — that creates false
  failures on every PR.

### Shipping procedure

1. Bump version in `manifest.json` (the release workflow also patches it from the tag, but keep them in sync)
2. Create a GitHub release with tag `vX.Y.Z`
3. Let the Release workflow run — it builds the zip, validates structure, uploads, **and deploys the demo to GitHub Pages**
4. **Do not** manually re-upload or replace the release zip asset
5. After HACS picks up the new version, test on HA: verify the integration loads (`manifest/get` via websocket must succeed)

### Demo page (GitHub Pages)

`https://florianhorner.github.io/lightener-curve-editor/` is served from the `gh-pages`
branch (not `docs/` on master). The Release workflow automatically deploys `docs/` →
`gh-pages` after every version cut, so the live demo always matches the shipped bundle.

**If you need to push a demo update outside a release** (e.g. HTML-only fix), push
directly to the `gh-pages` branch — the two files it needs are `index.html` and
`lightener-curve-card.js` at root level (same content as `docs/`).

## Development

- `conductor.json` — Conductor Mac app config: `setup` runs `scripts/conductor-setup`, `run` button starts `scripts/develop`
- `scripts/conductor-setup` — one-shot workspace bootstrap (macOS-safe local bootstrap or Debian/root system bootstrap, plus JS deps)
- `scripts/setup-python` — create the local Python 3.13 `.venv`, install backend deps, and write `.env.workspace`
- `scripts/setup` — Debian/system bootstrap that installs system packages, then delegates to `scripts/setup-python`
- `scripts/test-python` — canonical backend test command; runs `.venv/bin/python -m pytest`
- `scripts/test-fast` — fast local inner loop: backend pytest + frontend vitest + frontend typecheck
- `scripts/ha-sync` — direct SSH sync to a test Home Assistant config dir; bypasses release/HACS and never restarts HA
- `scripts/develop` — run HA locally with the integration
- `scripts/lint` — run linters
- Integration source lives in `custom_components/lightener/`
- Frontend card JS lives in `custom_components/lightener/frontend/`
- Card source (if editing) lives in `js/`

### Fast Testing Loop (default)

- Future agents should default to the fast loop in this repo instead of asking for a release cut or HACS update for routine testing.
- First local validation step: `scripts/test-fast`
- Fastest live HA UI loop: `scripts/ha-sync --frontend-only`
- Full live HA sync when needed: `scripts/ha-sync`
- Store SSH target configuration in the gitignored `.context/ha-sync.env` file.
- `scripts/ha-sync` never restarts Home Assistant. If Python code changed, tell the user a manual HA restart or equivalent reload is still required.
- Only use the release/HACS flow when validating packaging, distribution, or an actual release candidate.

### Curve editor release baseline

- Before changing the Lightener curve editor UI, graph behavior, scrubber,
  presets, add/remove-light flow, or card layout, inspect both MemPalace
  (`wing=lightener`) and the latest relevant release tag.
- Treat the released editor interaction model as the baseline. Do not replace
  native-feeling Home Assistant patterns, smooth curve behavior, or existing
  add/edit/remove-light features unless the task explicitly asks for that
  behavioral change.
- When fixing regressions, prefer a narrow patch on top of the released behavior
  over reworking the whole editor surface.
- Before landing curve editor changes, write down the editor contract being
  preserved: current feature inventory, native Home Assistant interaction
  pattern, visual curve behavior, backend brightness semantics, and local
  preview scenarios. Validate against that contract, not just against tests.
- Keep visual rendering and real integration behavior separate. A curve may be
  rendered smoothly, but badges, list values, saved config, and live light
  preview must stay aligned with backend interpolation unless the backend
  behavior changes in the same PR.

### Triaging bundle / caching issues

If a user reports that a recently-shipped card feature is missing, a card
editor field is blank, or a button "does nothing" after an upgrade, **do
not treat them as independent bugs**. The most common cause is that the
live `lightener-curve-card` class in the user's browser is from a prior
bundle (HACS install-version vs on-disk mismatch, or browser
SW/HTTP-cache serving the old bundle first; `customElements.define` is
one-shot, so the old class wins and the fresh bundle is silently ignored).

See [docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for the diagnostic
snippet and full recovery sequence before writing any source patch.

### Backend test entrypoint

- Never rely on bare `pytest` from the ambient shell PATH in this repo.
- Default to `scripts/test-python` for backend tests.
- If you need direct pytest flags, use `.venv/bin/python -m pytest ...` or `source .env.workspace` first. The generated `.env.workspace` defines a shell `pytest()` wrapper that routes to the repo-managed Python 3.13 venv.

## Commit message standards

This repo follows the [engineering-standards commit-message spec](https://github.com/florianhorner/engineering-standards/blob/main/specs/commit-message-spec.md).

**Quick rule:** Conventional Commits (`type(scope): subject`, ≤72 chars). A `Why:` body line is REQUIRED when type is `feat` AND >50 lines changed; otherwise optional.

**Local invocation:** Use the `/commit` skill in Claude Code / Conductor. Default behavior is dry-run (drafts a message and shows the validator output without committing); pass `--commit` to actually create the commit. Manual `git commit` works too — the local `commit-msg` hook validates either path.

**Per-repo cheat sheet:** [`./CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) carries the 30-second cheat sheet, good/bad examples, banned patterns, exempt subjects, bot allowlist, and bypass policy. It is self-sufficient for cloud agents (Claude Code Cloud, Codex web) that only see repo-local files.

**Machine-readable rules:** [`.config/commit-rules.json`](.config/commit-rules.json) is a SHA-pinned vendored copy of the upstream `commit-rules.json`. The validator binary, commit-msg hook, and CI workflow all read this file. Do not hand-edit — re-run `bootstrap-repo.sh` to refresh.

**Bypass:** `git commit --no-verify` requires a `Policy-Override: <reason>` trailer to pass CI. Logged to `~/.commit-bypass.log` by the pre-push hook.
