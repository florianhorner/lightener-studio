# Troubleshooting: card ships new code but UI looks like an old version

If a user reports **any** of these after an integration upgrade, treat them as
one compound symptom — not three independent bugs:

- Card editor renders the "Entity" label but the `<ha-entity-picker>` is blank.
- In-card light-management UI (Add light / per-row Remove) is missing even
  though the shipped version advertises it.
- Scrubber or legend shows behaviour from an older version (e.g., per-light
  value badges appear even though the current release removed them from the
  scrubber, or the Preview button appears in the card header instead of the
  scrubber panel).

These share one root cause: **the class currently registered under
`<lightener-curve-card>` in the user's browser is not the class from the
current bundle.**

## Why it happens (in order of what to check)

1. **HACS "installed version" label vs bytes on disk.** HACS sometimes
   reports `vX.Y.Z` installed while the files under
   `/config/custom_components/lightener/` are from an older release. This
   has been reproduced. Fix: HACS → three-dot menu on the Lightener repo →
   **Redownload** → pick the target version → restart Home Assistant.
2. **Browser Workbox / HTTP cache held the previous bundle.** HA's service
   worker (`home-assistant-frontend`, scope `/`) and the browser's HTTP
   disk cache can both keep the pre-upgrade card JS. The first page load
   after upgrade wins the race and registers the **old** class via
   `customElements.define('lightener-curve-card', …)`. Because `define` is
   one-shot, every subsequent fetch of the fresh bundle has its
   `customElements.define` call silently fail (`NotSupportedError`). Every
   instance on the page continues to use the stale class — missing methods
   and missing render branches from the new version.
3. **Stray shadow copy on disk.** A manual file in `/config/www/…` or
   `/config/www/community/…` referenced by a Lovelace resource can shadow
   the integration's registered static path
   (`/lightener/lightener-curve-card.js` → `custom_components/lightener/frontend/lightener-curve-card.js`).

## Diagnostic: prove the active class is stale

Run in DevTools on the HA page:

```js
(async () => {
  const ctor = customElements.get('lightener-curve-card');
  const proto = ctor?.prototype;
  const hasCanManageLights = proto && !!Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(proto, '_canManageLights');
  const r = await fetch('/lightener/lightener-curve-card.js', { cache: 'no-store' });
  const t = await r.text();
  const hash = [...new Uint8Array(await crypto.subtle.digest('SHA-256', new TextEncoder().encode(t)))]
    .map(b => b.toString(16).padStart(2, '0')).join('').slice(0, 12);
  return JSON.stringify({
    className: ctor?.name,            // minified, e.g. "He" vs "Be" — just needs to be stable per-version
    hasCanManageLights,               // must be true on any build that ships PR #52
    bytes: t.length,
    cardVersion: window.__LIGHTENER_CURVE_CARD_VERSION__,   // e.g. "2.15.0"
    sha256Prefix: hash,
    lastModified: r.headers.get('last-modified')
  });
})();
```

**Healthy state on current `master`:**
`hasCanManageLights === true`, `cardVersion` matches the installed release.

Compare `bytes` to the server file:
```bash
# locally:
wc -c < custom_components/lightener/frontend/lightener-curve-card.js
# over SSH:
ssh "$HA_SSH_TARGET" "wc -c < /config/custom_components/lightener/frontend/lightener-curve-card.js"
```
If the two sizes agree but the browser still has a stale class, you're in
case 2 (browser cache). If they disagree, you're in case 1 or 3.

## Recovery sequence

Run these in order. Stop as soon as the diagnostic above is healthy.

1. **Fix the file on disk first.** HACS Redownload + restart HA (case 1),
   or `scripts/ha-sync --frontend-only` for a dev loop, or delete the
   shadow file in `/config/www/…` (case 3).
2. **Clear the browser.** In DevTools Console on the HA origin:
   ```js
   (async () => {
     for (const r of await navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations()) await r.unregister();
     for (const k of await caches.keys()) await caches.delete(k);
     await fetch('/lightener/lightener-curve-card.js', { cache: 'reload' });
     location.reload();
   })();
   ```
   The explicit `fetch({ cache: 'reload' })` is required: `location.reload()`
   alone will often serve the stale copy from the browser's HTTP disk
   cache if the response lacked a strong `Cache-Control` header.
3. **If the registered class is still the old one,** close every HA tab
   on this browser profile (bfcache / shared module graph across tabs can
   resurrect the old class) and reopen one tab. Re-run the diagnostic.

## Automatic mitigation (shipped in v2.15.0+)

As of **v2.15.0**, the card module is served at a **path-stamped URL** —
`/lightener/lightener-curve-card.<version>.js` — instead of the old
`?v=<version>` query-string form. This forces a genuine cache miss in the HA
Workbox service worker on every upgrade, because the URL path itself changes
(Workbox ignores query parameters when matching cached entries).

The unversioned `/lightener/lightener-curve-card.js` path is still served for
back-compat with users who manually added that URL as a Lovelace resource.

Additionally, if the loaded card class reports a version mismatch via
`window.__LIGHTENER_CURVE_CARD_VERSION__`, the panel triggers a one-time
`location.reload()` (gated by `sessionStorage` to prevent reload loops) so
the new bundle takes over without manual intervention.

**Known gap (tracked as P2):** The panel JS itself (`lightener-panel.js`) is
still served via a `?v=<version>` query-string URL. Workbox ignores query
parameters when matching cached entries, so a Workbox-cached stale panel can
still load after an upgrade. If the stale panel requests an old path-stamped
card URL that the new server has not registered, the panel falls back to the
unversioned card path. This edge case will be addressed in a follow-on release
that path-stamps the panel URL as well.

If you still see stale behaviour after an upgrade, run the recovery sequence
above — the automatic mitigation covers the common case but cannot clear a
fully-cached service worker or a shadow file on disk.
