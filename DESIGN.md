# Design System

This document captures the current visual system for the Lightener curve editor so future UI work extends a consistent language instead of re-inventing it component by component.

## Principles

- Use layered, tinted panels instead of flat cards. The graph, scrubber, legend, and panel controls each sit on a slightly mixed surface so the editor reads as a workspace rather than a form.
- Keep editing feedback immediate. Dirty state, preview state, save state, and loading state should all be visible in-place without modal dialogs.
- Favor compact, scannable controls. The editor is often used from tablets and narrow dashboards, so labels stay short and actions stay physically close to the graph.
- Make color supportive, not exclusive. Curves use color, dash patterns, shape markers, and labels together so the UI remains legible for colorblind and assistive-tech users.

## Tokens

### Surfaces

- `--card-bg`: primary card surface
- `--panel-bg`: mixed workspace panel surface
- `--graph-bg`: graph background color; used by `curve-graph` for the scrubber dim overlay
- `--divider`: low-contrast structural borders
- `--lightener-panel-surface`: panel shell surface
- `--lightener-panel-border`: panel shell border

### Type

- `--text-xs`: 9px utility labels
- `--text-sm`: 12px status copy and controls
- `--text-md`: 13px list rows
- `--text-lg`: 14px card heading
- `--secondary-text`: card-level alias for Home Assistant `--secondary-text-color`; graph and footer children use this alias when the card shell supplies it, with `#616161` fallback

Typography rules:

- Section labels use uppercase, tight tracking, and secondary text color.
- Main titles use modest weight and slightly negative tracking.
- Status and helper copy should remain short enough to scan in one line when possible.

### Shape

- Outer cards: 16px radius
- Embedded panels and sub-panels: 12px radius
- Buttons: 8px radius in-card, pill radius in panel-level callouts
- Interactive dots: 6px visual point with larger invisible hit target

### Motion

- Success state fades instead of snapping away.
- Undo and cancel use a short cubic ease animation.
- Loading uses a shimmer skeleton that preserves graph space.
- Sticky mobile footer should feel anchored, not floating; use blur and a subtle divider instead of heavy shadows.

### Breakpoints

- `500px` is the shared component mobile breakpoint for graph, scrubber, legend, and footer touch-target adjustments.
- Use `MOBILE_MEDIA` from `js/src/utils/breakpoint-styles.ts` for component `css` `@media` blocks, and `MOBILE_BREAKPOINT_MEDIA_QUERY` from `js/src/utils/breakpoints.ts` for `matchMedia` consumers, instead of hand-writing nearby values. `breakpoints.ts` stays framework-free; `breakpoint-styles.ts` is the Lit-aware adapter that wraps the value in a `css` fragment.
- The editor shell may still use wider layout breakpoints for column stacking; do not mix those shell-layout thresholds with the 500px touch/mobile component threshold.

## Component Patterns

### Curve Card

- Header is quiet and compact in embedded mode.
- Workspace becomes two columns on wide layouts and a stacked flow on narrow ones.
- On narrow screens, action buttons live in a sticky footer directly below the graph stack.

### Graph

- Show grid, diagonal reference, and axis labels at all times.
- Selected curve stays visually dominant; non-selected curves dim.
- Editing affordances:
  - Pointer drag moves points without requiring a selection; the **origin point** (leftmost) is Y-only constrained — a dashed stroke and `ns-resize` cursor signal restricted movement
  - Double-click (`Enter` on keyboard) adds a point — requires a selected light/curve target
  - Right-click, long-press, or `Space` removes a point — requires a selected light/curve target; origin point is protected from accidental long-press deletion
  - Keyboard focus on points enables arrow-key movement, `Enter` add, and `Space` remove (ARIA labels distinguish origin [Y-only, no remove] from all other points [free move + remove])
- SVGs must include a descriptive `<desc>` summary for screen readers.

### Scrubber

- Track aligns with graph padding so preview position matches the plotted data.
- Value badges are a trust feature; if not all fit, show `+N more` rather than silently clipping. Badge overflow measurement is skipped while the list is expanded to prevent flicker loops.
- Preview state should always be reversible and clearly announced.

### Preview Toggle

- A **Preview all lights** button in the scrubber panel enters preview mode independently of scrubber position, defaulting to 50% if the scrubber has not been touched.
- Lights restore to their pre-preview state on: toggle off, `disconnectedCallback`, or entity change.
- Preview brightness changes ease over a fixed short transition (0.25s) using Home Assistant's native `transition` — both when entering or scrubbing preview and when restoring, so lights glide instead of snapping. Devices without native transition support fall back to an abrupt change.
- The button must show clear active/inactive state; do not rely on color alone.

### Legend

- Include a section label: `Group lights`.
- Each item combines color, shape, name, and visibility affordance.
- Selected state uses an underline accent instead of heavier framing.

### Hidden Parents

- Hidden dashboard parents such as tabs, popups, and stacked dashboards must preserve graph space until the card becomes visible again.
- Prefer visibility/resize guards only after reproducing a concrete hidden-parent failure in a browser; avoid speculative observers that can fight Home Assistant's native dashboard lifecycle.
- If a hidden-parent issue is reproduced, the guard should be scoped to graph sizing/re-rendering and must not alter save, preview, or entity-load lifecycle behavior.

### Panel

- The entity selector sits in a distinct control row ahead of the editor workspace.
- Unsaved entity switches use an inline confirmation bar, never a blocking browser dialog.
- Empty states should explain what Lightener is, how to start, and where to go next.

## Accessibility Baseline

- Do not rely on color alone to distinguish curves.
- Keep touch targets at mobile-friendly sizes.
- Provide keyboard paths for scrubber, legend, and graph point editing.
- Use `role="status"` or `role="alert"` for transient save/load feedback where appropriate.

## Change Rule

When adding a new editor surface or control, first decide:

1. Which existing panel pattern it belongs to
2. Which token drives its spacing, shape, and type
3. How its dirty/loading/error state is shown inline
4. What the keyboard and screen-reader path is
